# uni-ml-classifier
This is a basic convolutional neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. Convolution, linear, and pooling layers were used. 
Pytorch 0.4.1 is used and accelerated via CUDA if a device exists.
Batch normalisation, tensor normalisation, and data augmentation were added to reduce the generalisation error.  

A more detailed description is available in part 1 of the ![report](https://github.com/BlackenedGem/uni-ml-classifier/blob/master/ML%20Report.pdf).
